:wave: **Bio**: Hi, I'm Lu. I am an Assistant Professor in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Penn State University; I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu/) and [the Center for Socially Responsible AI](https://ai.psu.edu/). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. from University of Virginia supervised by Dr. [Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/), M.S. and B.S. from Beihang University, in Computer Science. I have also interned at Didi Lab, LinkedIn and Pinterest Lab. [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/Lu_cv.pdf).

:bulb: **Research Interests**: My research interests lie in machine learning and data sciences, with a primary focus on interpreting the behavior of ML paradigms and further building trustworthiness in them. I'm particularly facinated by transformative ML paradigms, including large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, federated learning, self-supervised learning, graph neural networks and more. By understanding and hardening their working mechanism, my research vision is to establish algorithmic foundations for AI-enabled systems to work reliably in practical environment concerning biased, noisy, and out-of-distribution inputs. 

:fire: **Openings for 2024-2025**: <span style="color:red"> Iâ€™m looking for highly motivated students, including PhDs (fully-funded), Masters, undergraduates, and interns. Please kindly read [Open Position](/position) for more information before contacting me. </span>
