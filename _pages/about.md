:wave: **Bio**: Hi, I'm Lu. I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State University starting 2022 Fall. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Virginia in 2022, under supervision of Dr. Hongning Wang. I recieved my M.s. and B.S. in 2017 and 2014 respectively, from Computer Science at Beihang University. I have also interned at Didi Lab, LinkedIn and Pinterest Lab. [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/Lu_cv.pdf)

:pushpin: **Research interests**: I have a broad interest in machine learning and data mining. I am especially fascinated by explaining the behavior of advanced ML diagrams (e.g., large language model, self-supervised learning, graph neural networks etc), and further building trustworthiness in them. My research vision is to establish foundations for intelligent systems to work reliably in practical environment concerning bias, noise, and out-of-distribution inputs. To be more specific:
- Trustworthiness (robustness, safety, fairness, generalization) of machine learning models (large language models, contrastive learning, graph learning etc.)
- Machine learning explainability, and its reliability 
- Data mining and data science in real-world applications

:fire: **Openings for 2023-2024**: <span style="color:red"> Iâ€™m looking for highly motivated students, including PhDs (fully-funded), Masters, undergraduates, and interns to join my group. Please kindly read Open Position for more information before contact me. </span>
